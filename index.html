      <p>I am a first-year political science PhD student at the University of Florida. I specialize in election administration and voter turnout, particularly at the local level both in the United States and abroad.<br>I have been an active member of UF's Election Data Science Lab since 2021, and I also founded the <a href="https://maxwelections.github.io/github.io/projects.html">Global Archive of Election Administration (GAEA)</a> in 2024.</p>
      <p>My undergraduate thesis constituted the first large-scale study of Florida's municipal elections, accounting for 377 of 410 total localities in the state.<br></p>
        <p>In addition to my academic research, I have experience as a research and policy fellow for State Representative Omari Hardy in 2021, as a campaign finance intern for Representative Hardy's congressional campaign that same year, and as a communications intern for the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections in 2023.</p>
        <p>Since I joined UF's Election Data Science Lab as an undergraduate student, I worked under Dr. Michael P. McDonald and Dr. Daniel A. Smith on a number of projects, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A review of literature citing the U.S. E.A.C.'s Election Administration and Voting Survey</li>
              <li>An analysis of voter registration changes after the January 6th insurrection</li>
              <li>Statewide redistricting of Florida's legislative and congressional districts</li>
              <li>Collection of national precinct boundary GIS files as part of the Lab's Voting and Election Science Team (VEST)</li>
            </ul>
