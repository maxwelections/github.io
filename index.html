      <p>I am a first-year political science PhD student studying American and Comparative Politics at the University of Florida. I specialize in election administration and voter turnout, particularly at the local level in the United States and abroad.<br>I have been an active member of UF's Election Data Science Lab since 2021, and I founded the Global Archive of Election Administration (GAEA)</a> in 2024. For more information, click the GAEA logo at the bottom of the page.</p>
      <br>
              <p>My most recently published paper constituted the first large-scale study of Florida's municipal elections, accounting for 377 of 410 total localities in the state.<br></p>
        <br>
              <p>As a member of the Election Lab, I have worked under Dr. Michael P. McDonald and Dr. Daniel A. Smith on a number of projects, including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A review of literature citing the Election Administration and Voting Survey</li>
              <li>An analysis of voter registration changes after the January 6th insurrection</li>
              <li>Statewide redistricting of Florida's legislative and congressional districts</li>
              <li>Collection of national precinct boundary GIS files as part of the Lab's Voting and Election Science Team (VEST)</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
              <p>I also created the Lab's logo. Click the icon below visit the Lab website.</p>
