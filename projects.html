        <h3>Global Archive of Election Administration</h3>
        <p>I founded the Global Archive of Election Administration (GAEA) in 2024 in order to centralize dates and data for all elections in human history. Visit <a href="https://global-aea.org">global-aea.org</a> to track our progress as we prepare the database for a full public launch.</p>

        <h3>Florida Archival Election Project</h3>
        <p>The State of Florida maintained no historical record of precinct election results for state elections until to 2012 and has never collected local election results. Since 2024, I have traveled to election offices across the state in order to document and archive all available election results, including by precinct and for local office, as far back in time as possible. As of July 2025, I have successfully archived results for 15 of 54 counties for which physical records exist. The ultimate objective of this project is to create a free public archive of digitized Florida election results. Status updates will be posted from @MaxwElections on Twitter<a href="twitter.com/maxwelections"></a> and Bluesky<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxwelections.bsky.social"></a>.</p>
